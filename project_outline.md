# Personal Project Plan

## Project Name
Siri but now when I ask it questions it will actually give me the answer and not just show me responses from google

## Brief Description
I am building a personal assistant for day to day tasks. This will include connecting to applications such as my calender or emails, having a conversation over voice and having access to this on my phone. Ideally it will run off a local server. This will bring together a lot of different aspects about building an AI application and allow me to bolt on new features as I go.

## Learning Objectives
- Abstraction layers and tool use/MCP
- Integrating voice conversations using tools such as whisper
- Use Evaluations to test latency and efficiency
- Running a local model
- Anonymising data when talking to external tools where possible
- Enabling authentication on the local server
- Accessing a local model outside of the local network
- Accessing the model on a mobile device

## Project Scope
[What features or components will your project include? What will you NOT include to keep the scope manageable?]
Phase 1:
- Uses a cloud model
- CRUD operations for calender and email over voice

Phase 2:
- Runs on a local model
- Can be accessed outside of the local network

Phase 3:
- Runs on my phone using the browser (separate app is out of scope for this project)

## Technologies
- Langchain
- Whisper
- Gemini
- Ollama
- Basic auth for server (tech TBC)
[List the technologies, frameworks, or libraries you plan to use]

## Timeline
Phase 1:
1 month

Phase 2:
1 month (assuming my hardware can run a model capable of handling the workload)

Phase 3:
Unknown. More research will be done closer to the time. This may not even be possible.


## Success Criteria
When all phases are complete and I can add an event to my calender using my voice on my phone.
